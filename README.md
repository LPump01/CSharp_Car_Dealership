<h1>C# Car Dealership</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this C# console application, I used constructors, getters and setters, method creation, and inheritance to make a dealership that has cars. The methods changed information about the cars for example Sell() changes the status of a car to sold. All of the methods and functions were made in the car class which the Progran class inherited. The car objects were hard-coded into the Program class and changes made were using functions in the car class.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
